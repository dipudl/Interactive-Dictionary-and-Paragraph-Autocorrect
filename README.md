##### Some important and missing notes:

1) All codes and files (except images) are open-source & anyone can use the code and files of this program at their own risk.

2) To open and save a text file from "Paragraph Auto-correct", you need to link 'libcomdlg32.a' to your project. This file may vary with the computer, so I suggest you to use 'libcomdlg32.a' present in your own windows PC.

3) Details about this project and "data.json" & "words.txt" used in this program is clearly given in "final-report.pdf".

4) If you face any problem while using this program then feel free to contact us at "dipu234dahal@gmail.com".
